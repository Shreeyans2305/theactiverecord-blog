## Right to Repair
Have you ever wondered how many things you actctually own and are yours by all means?. Well the answer is probably way less than you think in terms of technology. In the days of the internet the way things are being bought is way different than it used to be. For example if you wanted to buy, in terms sof tech a Type-writer or a telephone or a copy of microsoft office you would own the said thing and could do whatever you want with it. You can fix your telephone yourself without knowing from where you bought it. You could take the Type-writer to a local repair shop knowing that it would be proper and working after the repair. But now you have to know where your phone is bought from to go there and fix it. The local shops might not have the right equipment and instructions for the repair of the item. The company which you bought the product from can carge you literally any price they want because where else are you going to go to get the thing you bought to be fixed. And the steps about the right to repair that are being taken right now should have been done way before.

## Premium
Life seems empty without the usual entertainment in our lives. And as we move towards the 22nd century we keep focusing on making life easier. Part of that process is making entertainment and various other services accessible from the comfort of our homes. If you think about it Netflix, Disney+, Adobe and a lot more but also there is one more type in which the initial tech is free on the face of but there are a lot of payment options for a bonus or an additional service like services like spotify. It's not necessarily a bad thing to pay a premium on a yearly/monthly basis but sometimes you get so caught up in the services of premium that you choose to ignore sites or apps with a pay once or free alternatives and that is the point that people need to realize. Looking at human behaviour it seems that humans would almost always go for the cheaper options but sometimes that is not true like in these cases. Like in place of the streaming services you can try Youtube or twitch there are a lot of platforms for photo-editing and other things you just need to research. 
**YOU JUST NEED TO OWN IT!**
