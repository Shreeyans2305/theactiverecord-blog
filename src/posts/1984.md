## 1984
What started as fiction really connected itself with the present. This really made me question my ideology and my belief in freedom. What does it all mean? There is not a definitive answer but I hope that every reader in this case linked them to Winston to a certain degree. We all think we know what we stand for and are the least gulliable. But that is far from the truth. One really needs only to create fear in certain minds to control a whole. As the book states “Freedom is slavery” is just about the dumbest shit I’ve ever heard. But in this dystopian nightmare of a world it made perfect sense to people. And I’m afraid that at one point this existed in the real world as well. I dont know how but we were really close to 1984 becoming reality. I can't imagine a world where to think is to commit crime. Monitoring your every move are the forces that demand absolute power. But it does show a recurring motif that in order for a system to be immortal the minds of the people in the system shall be controlled. You aren't aware of the possible freedom if you have never known of it's existence. It is surprisingly easy to change the past if you have complete control over the present. The idea never really occurred to me that the past exists in nothing but documents and records that can be altered. There is another place however where the past exists and that is the mind and once you can convince the mind, you ar the king. With enough power one can create hysteria. The only way there is to escape this mass brainwash is to be conscious, is to be aware of what is happening and what has already happened. Because no matter what, they'll never know your real thoughts and beliefs, preserving the idea that society is made up of distinctive indivduals and not a hive mind. **And in a world that has accepted and cherished darkness your mind can be the harbinger of light.**
