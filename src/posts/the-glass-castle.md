**The Castle of the Sunk Cost Fallacy**

An epic journey through a life filled with drama, hope and most importantly faith. The story is the epitome of the fact that when faith disappears, so do people. The author, Jeanatte Walls has taken storytelling to another level by her thoughtful and optimistic vision. The Glass Castle by Jeannette Walls is a book that is sure to make you tear up. At first the seemingly dogmatic family cut off from society seem to be very absurd but as we get to know the Walls’ more, we learn about the differences in their beliefs. The family seems to have gone through it all in a very small amount of time, from being borderline rich to having nothing. The dissatisfied kids always tried to make up for the shortcomings of their parents. The parents would improvise and always try to make the best of any situation with the least amount of effort and often with their words rather than their actions. The author makes us feel for her, makes us feel like we were present in the story and had all the resentment and love that she had for other people. The annoyingly optimistic moods of the mother, the drunk yet commited father, it all blends together in one big chaotic way, it's beautiful. There arent enough words to describe the sheer amount of ups and downs, emotions and scenarios depicted in this book. It’s a masterpiece, make sure to add this to your reading list. The true Glass Castle in reality is made up of life, faith, hope, and MANIA. (PS: Page 285 is sure to make you cry)
