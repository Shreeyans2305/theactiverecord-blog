The Nature of Life and Beyond
“Seven Brief Lessons in Physics,” by Dr. Carlo Rovelli is a reflective piece of the grand scale of the universe and it’s integrated mechanisms which go unnoticed and unappreciated. The book while being short in length manages to describe the intricate theories that describe our understanding of the universe in somewhat lamens terms. The book starts off by looking at the works of noteworthy characters in the field of science such as Newton, Einstein, Bohr, Heisenberg, etc. The concepts of space, time, gravity and what we know and more importantly what we dont is discussed at length which really puts the reader in perspective of the scientific forefront we have managed to build. While this book is impressively simple for the common reader, it would surely be much more appreciated by a person indulged in the field. The book might come off as esoteric at times and might be very difficult to comprehend. Though I feel like some leeway is deserved here as Dr.Rovelli is really trying to describe something that no person fully understands as of yet. It is quite impressive though as the book manages to explain to us (the readers) where we stand in the universe and its seemingly infinite complexity. A great read for a curious and scientific mind.
