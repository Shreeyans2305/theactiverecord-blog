## How memories work for me...
A memory for me is a complete mental and/or physical image of a given time. 
As far as I am aware, memories form at 2 points in time:
1. When something deeply impactful happens 
2. Absoloutely for no reason at all just for the shits and lols

The day you finally accomplished something you were aiming for, after a long and patient wait, or that one incredibly funny joke that you just can't forget. Most of the times, it is a memory of the time spent with the people closest to you. You might not realise it in the moment, but you can definitely tell afterwards that, "HOlY Sh#t I had an incredibly fun time" but the biggest tell of them all, is **Gratitude**, after the formation of a good memory, I've always felt so grateful about the world around me. However after the formation of a bad memory, it's the same 5 stages of Grief. And that's the thing not all of them are rainbows and unicorns though, some can be genuienly depressing and hurtful. We or at least I, can't choose what I remember.

Really no idea why random memories form. Like why do I remember exactly how I felt after having been dropped home after visiting my village in 2015. 
(Surprise, surprise, it was pukish)
But that's just the nature of random memories, they are for all intends and purposes **Random**.

## Where memories can be found...

Memories can be found in the the randomest of places. Sometimes, they are linked to a location. Your childhood home, your school,
(End of Beginning by Djo starts Playing...)
anything and everything can resurface a memoery.
Maybe it happens when you start writing a blog and remember how much fun you used to have filling up random google docs with nothing but your thoughts. Maybe you question why you ever stopped that habit of yours.

These days, we walk around with memory storage devices. There exist organizations that want to use our memories to show us ads? (Kinda weird ngl)

But more often than not, they are found with people. When you hang out with your childhood friends and suddenly you are transported to the days you were 10 running around playing hide-n-seek, playing random Doraemon Flash games and watching IPL matches. Or with family, just hanging around being present, and getting to chill, or go out and try new foods you probably mispronounce the names of. **People awaken more memories than any recorded movie or picture ever can.**

## How can they be nurtured?

**You can always keep upgrading your iCloud storage, but it will never be enuogh to compensate for a lifetime of memories.** If you truly want to nurture your memories, I feel like the only way to do that is by revisiting that place you haven't been to in like forever, calling up those people you've not reached out to in a long time, spend time doing things you used to love but haven't had the time for. It might be difficult, time-consuming but I feel like I owe it to my past as well as present and for sure the future to not only nurture the memories I have but to make even new and more meaningful ones. I know that I'm not even good at any of the things I mentioned above but I know they hold value. They hold memories both with people and with my past self. 
So don't be afraid, accept, cherish and revisit the memories you have, or wait for them to one day appear out of the blue and hold them close Riley! 
(That was an Inside Out Reference btw)


Crazy how memories are synonymous with people sometimes huh.
