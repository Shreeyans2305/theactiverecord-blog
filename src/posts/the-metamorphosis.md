The Metamorphosis by Franz Kafka is a fictionalized story depicting the shallow truth behind modern life in a strange and subtle manner. The protagonist of the story, Gregor Samsa finds himself waking up one day having been transformed into a vermin. What follows is not a happy adventure tale of a man living his life in the insect world. Rather, it is the story of the difficulties faced by him and his family because of this transposition. The story follows the struggles of the previously working breadwinner of the family (Gregor Samsa) and the changing perception of him by his family as they come to terms with this predicament.

More deeply, and rather subtly, the book revolves around the ideas of modern life and bureaucracy. Measuring the worth of a person by their utility and how that ties in with emotional attachments are the key ideas covered in a kafkaesque manner. The treatment of a person in society solely based on utility is not just relative but ingrained in every common household. Conversely, it is seen how devotional attachment can metamorphose into burden and eventually resentment. The reader discovers the flaws in the mental framework universally adopted by us humans, delving into the causes of dehumanization.

I started reading this book as a sort of introduction to canonical literature. I find Franz Kafka’s piece to be unfiltered. It has shown me a new way to look at the world through a unique perspective and finding that people more often than not fit into this sometimes selfish theme while forming attachments and designating value by no fault of their own. It is simply **human** nature.
