I am going to be discreet. I can never capture this man's life in words. Steve Jobs was not the kind hearted, gullible type absolutely not he was the one who would make you feel bad about your existence whenever you f*ucked up. I really do wonder what went in the mind of someone to whom the world is so bipolar that a perosn may seem either a saint or the devil. I can cry ovet the fact that I will never get to meet Mr.Jobs in this life, but that doesnt mean that I dont get to meet him in the afterlife. I was 3 when Steve Jobs died and I regret not being able to meet him like I could have done anythin about it. Coming back to the book I feel like Steve Jobs never really could accept being sick. A pattern that I noticed with the characters in this book is that they were saints only when they were blind to anything but their work. Apple has been able to use the push they received from Jobs’s legacy and add to it. I am at a loss of words. The only book that made me come close to crying has been this one. Walter Isaacson, much like Steve Jobs, seems to me somewhat of a perfectionist.

I can probably  open a random page in this book and expan the ideas from it into a whole new book. Steve was a minimalist with the little things he had, he wanted them to be perfect and nothing else. At one point it felt like he could be a child having mood swings saying NO!  To something he didnt like with his hands folded. At some points of time it felt like he would commit a bit too much. Not eating anything but vegan food, making his children feel abandoned when he was on his project.

Steve’s reality distortion field was the most jarring and breathtaking concept to me and the book doesnt lack mentioning it. The man lived beyond the miseries of a commener. He was too busy revoltionizing a whole new industry to care about politics or some other crap. It also helps that he had deep appreciation for what **he considered** real ART he could identify the committed people in the room may it be musicians or hiring an **‘A PLAYER’**. He tried surrounding himself with nothing but what **he considered** the best. Players like Microsoft, Google and Sony were not competition to him, they were merely flawed corporations filled with IDIOTS and ‘C players’. Steve’s genius doesn't only pertain to Apple but to Pixar, to NeXT and all the products they designed. To say the least he was a hustler. To the people who really knew him, he would be the one on the throne, the one who could change what people thought was unchangable and went against human nature, the one who would enlighten millions, the one who would **THINK DIFFERENT**.
