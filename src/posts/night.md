**Grit won’t let go;**


The ‘NIGHT’ by Elie Wiesel is the thoughtful depiction of a harrowing and mortifying experience of human society of the not so distant past which has been gripplingly told by the author. Hope has been slain but the persistent grit is the only thing that parts the author from death. The perspective of the writer might seem like one of a post apocalyptic world but is a real experience. Having lost the will to live, the line between death and life hangs on by a thin margin. Death aludes all here, injustice prevails for what seems to be eternity. Most have lost all hope and given into their denouemental fate. At such moments, the only thing that drives you to keep living are primary survival instincts. The human body is trained to not die, to not give up, even when everything worth fighting for is lost, hopes of survival are grim at best, we won’t let go. Indeed this period of human history must not be forgotten and will not be forgotten as long as there are people to tell the stories. The engrossed reader feels like they are in the writer's shoes and are experiencing the atrocities first hand. Pain is no longer what hurts, what hurts is that the God that was supposed to swoop in and save the day never seems to arrive. The author sees God in the slain believers. He mentions multiple times, ‘My god is murdered.’ The horrendous practice of racism, castism, sexism must be stopped to avoid history from repeating itself. To preserve the author's legacy we must know that action is the only remedy to indifference and that to forget the dead would be akin to killing them for a second time. Sometimes even when the body has given up, the soul which unites humanity has not, does not and will never give up hope, hope of a brighter day, hope of living.
