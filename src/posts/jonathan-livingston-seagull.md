**The Power of the Unhinged**
‘Jonathan Livingston Seagull,’written by Richard Bach is truly the epitome of the duality in the word 'limit'. For being limitless in a limited world takes not just courage but also power. One needs to be mad about their cause, for, true change in ideals need an ungodly amount of patience and courage. The protagonist of the story, Jonathan Livingston Seagull truly shows the reader how to fly the unthinkable flight. Dogma exists because perfection needs inhuman amounts of passion. To be without hindrance is to surround yourself with people who are nurturing a world with the right ideals. When all hope is lost you are simply at the mercy of your limits and nothing else. This short 1-2 hour read filled with fun visuals and imagery and is certainly worth _it_.
