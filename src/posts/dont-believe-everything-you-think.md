**Stop Thinking!**
I’ll preface this short review by saying that the author Joseph Nguyen promised that you won’t be the same person by the end of the book and it’s more than fair enough to say that this promise was delivered. It seems hard to capture such a life changing book within a summary but I’ll try my best. “Don’t Believe Everything You Think.” by Joseph Nguyen is a perspective piece wherein, you will be taken through a journey of dumbfoundingly straightforward realizations of the facts of life. It is scary how relatable and accurate this book can be, this book in my humble opinion is for everybody, ever. The book is filled with universal truths and morals which everyone could find helpful and fulfilling. The main plot of the book is the difference between Thinking and Thought. To the unelightened mind, thinking and thought would make no difference but the eerily profound difference between these two might just be the key to changing your life forever. You can tell that the book comes from a place of love and understanding and the aura of the person grasping the concepts in this book changes forever, I genuinely cannot recommend this book enough, be sure to give it a read!
